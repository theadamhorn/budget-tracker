## Description
This is a site for a person to track and account for their finances. It allows a user to input and track their regular income and expenses. The nice thing about this application is that when a connection to the internet is weak or nonexistent, a user is able to input their transactions and will log to the tracker when back online. This application uses JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MongoDB and Mongoose for database functionality, and deployed on Heroku.

## Installation
As this program uses Mongoose, Express, and Morgan dependencies, you will want to open an integrated terminal in the project folder to make sure those are installed. When cloning the respository, the package.json should already list the dependencies needed. First, you'll need to make sure the dependancies are installed on your maching by typing "npm i" into the terminal. Then, install the node modules by typing "npm i" into the terminal. If those dependancies are not listed in the package.json file, you can add them by typing "npm i express" and "npm i mongoose" into the integrated terminal.
